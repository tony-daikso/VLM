    r"""
    ## Adapted from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/master/lifelines/utils/concordance.py
    ## Modified to weight by ipcw (inverse probality of censor weight) to fit Uno's C-index
    ## Modified to use a time-dependent score

    Calculates the concordance index (C-index) between two series
    of event times. The first is the real survival times from
    the experimental data, and the other is the predicted survival
    times from a model of some kind.

    The c-index is the average of how often a model says X is greater than Y when, in the observed
    data, X is indeed greater than Y. The c-index also handles how to handle censored values
    (obviously, if Y is censored, it's hard to know if X is truly greater than Y).


    The concordance index is a value between 0 and 1 where:

    - 0.5 is the expected result from random predictions,
    - 1.0 is perfect concordance and,
    - 0.0 is perfect anti-concordance (multiply predictions with -1 to get 1.0)

    Parameters:
        event_times: (iterable)
            a length-n iterable of observed survival times.
        predicted_scores: (iterable)
            a length-n iterable of predicted scores - these could be survival times, or hazards, etc. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/352183/use-median-survival-time-to-calculate-cph-c-statistic/352435#352435
        event_observed: (iterable, optional)
            a length-n iterable censorship flags, 1 if observed, 0 if not. Default None assumes all observed.

    Returns:
        c-index: (float) a value between 0 and 1.

    # Here's how this works.
    #
    # It would be pretty easy to do if we had no censored data and no ties. There, the basic idea
    # would be to iterate over the cases in order of their true event time (from least to greatest),
    # while keeping track of a pool of *predicted* event times for all cases previously seen (= all
    # cases that we know should be ranked lower than the case we're looking at currently).
    #
    # If the pool has O(log n) insert and O(log n) RANK (i.e., "how many things in the pool have
    # value less than x"), then the following algorithm is n log n:
    #
    # Sort the times and predictions by time, increasing
    # n_pairs, n_correct := 0
    # pool := {}
    # for each prediction p:
    #     n_pairs += len(pool)
    #     n_correct += rank(pool, p)
    #     add p to pool
    #
    # There are three complications: tied ground truth values, tied predictions, and censored
    # observations.
    #
    # - To handle tied true event times, we modify the inner loop to work in *batches* of observations
    # p_1, ..., p_n whose true event times are tied, and then add them all to the pool
    # simultaneously at the end.
    #
    # - To handle tied predictions, which should each count for 0.5, we switch to
    #     n_correct += min_rank(pool, p)
    #     n_tied += count(pool, p)
    #
    # - To handle censored observations, we handle each batch of tied, censored observations just
    # after the batch of observations that died at the same time (since those censored observations
    # are comparable all the observations that died at the same time or previously). However, we do
    # NOT add them to the pool at the end, because they are NOT comparable with any observations
    # that leave the study afterward--whether or not those observations get censored.
